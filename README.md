# Introduction
Common Integration Repository(CIR) aims to supply easy orchestration and application deployment in cloud network and edge environment on Intel architecture platform. It provides tarball package of ansible playbooks for automating installation and configuration of ingredients from single source which can be deployed on supported Intel BKC platforms. With CIR, users can setup network cluster environment to verify application deployment easily, and internal ingredients can verify the system robustness and compatibility with easy installtion and scaling management.

Related basic technology includes but not limited to: Docker Container, Kubernetes, Ansible, BMRA, OpenNESS, OVC, OpenVINO, VCMTS.


# Overview
CIR integrates well-known field network cluster orchestration framework of both cloud core and multi-access edge, and deploys typical cloud use case apllicaitons on the cluster with variety configuration to demonstrate Intel advanced network techonologies.

It takes usage of ansible playbooks and roles to supply customer an easy way to setup environment on Intel BKC platforms. 
* BMRA deployment is used to install container based bare metal NFV platform; 
* OpenNESS deployment is used to setup edge orchestration for edge service in multiple environment; 
* Use case deployment is used to deploy applications and services on cloud network or edge cluster:

Figure 1 -  Common Integration Main Components Overview

Ansible is an agentless configuration management tool that uses playbooks to perform actions on remote machines. CIR provides a set of playbooks to setup cloud native or edge orchestration and deploy related user applications on them. Following chart shows the high level ansible playbook topology:

<IMG src="docs/CommonPlatformHighLevelAnsiblePlaybook.png" height="350px">

Figure 2 -  Common Integration High level Ansible playbooks

1. BMRA: Build a bare metal container based cloud cluster setup on Intel platforms with accelerators. Multiple profiles are supplied for different users. Users can select profiles to config different advanced network techonology and device plugins, ex. SRIOV, QAT, DPDK, VPP etc. This is the basis for application deployment on cloud. Following is the architecture topology:
  
   <IMG src="docs/BMRAArchitectureTopology.png" height="450px">

   Figure 3 - BMRA Architecture Topology

   
2. OpenNESS: Setup edge cluster for edge services deployment and network functions across diverse network platform. OpenNESS supports both on-premises and network modes. CIR deploys with network mode, which leverages Kubernetes based cloud-native container orchestration stack to deploy edge cloud that can host applications, services and network functions. This is the basis for application deployment on edge cluster. Following is the OpenNESS network deployment topology:

   <IMG src="docs/OpennessNetworkDeploymentTop.png" height="350px">

   Figure 4 - OpenNESS Network Deployment Topology

3. Use Case: Some high profile cloud usage models are integrated here to demonstrate Common Integration capability for network orchestration and easy scale and manage the cluster with K8S, including CDN, ADI, SmartCity, VCMTS. 

These components can be combined with variety recipes according to customer focus: 
* User can setup bare matel NFV cluster with `BMRA[1]` only.
* User can setup pure edge sub system with `Openness[2]` only.
* User can deploy sample `Use case[3]` on cloud cluster with `BMRA[1]` .
* User can deploy sample `Use case[3]` on edge system with `Openness[2]`
* User can setup cloud+edge orchestration and deploy use case on it to emulate reality usage with `BMRA[1]` + `Openness[2]` + `Use case[3]`

Typical repices will be shown in following [Use Case](#use-case) in details.

# Deployment

## Ansible Host Prerequisites
   CIR uses python 3 as default ansible interpreter. Please change it to python2.7 on CentOS7.6 manually with step1 in below:
1. Edit and remove or comment "ansible_python_interpreter" in example/inventory.ini.
    ```
    [all:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
    ``` 
2. Prepare ansible host environment with following commands:
    ```
    # sudo yum install epel-release
    # sudo yum install ansible
    # easy_install pip
    # pip2 install jinja2 –upgrade
    # sudo yum install python36 –y
    # pip install netaddr
    ```
3. Enable passwordless login between all nodes in the cluster.
    ```
    # ssh-keygen
    # ssh-copy-id root@node-ip-address
    ```

## Get Playbooks and Config Variables
1. Get CIR repo to get ansible playbooks:
   ```
    # git clone https://github.com/intel/common-integration-repository.git

# SRIOV Network Device Plugin and SRIOV CNI plugin

## Cluster configuration options

In order to install SRIOV Network Device Plugin set `sriov_net_dp_enabled` value to `true` in your group vars file. Setting it to `false` will disable SRIOV Network Device Plugin installation and cause other related options to be ignored.
```
sriov_net_dp_enabled: true
```

You can also change the Kubernetes namespace used for the plugin deployment - by default it's `kube-system`.
```
sriov_net_dp_namespace: kube-system
```

It's possible to build and store image locally or use one from public external registry. If you want to use image from the Docker Hub (recommended and faster option), please use `false`.
```
sriov_net_dp_build_image_locally: false
```

The `example_net_attach_defs` dictionary allows for enabling/disabling automatic creation of example net-attach-def objects. If you want to create the example net-attach-def resource for use with the SRIOV Network Device Plugin and SRIOV CNI, please set below variable to `true`.
```
example_net_attach_defs:
  sriov_net_dp: true
```

## Worker node specific options

There's also a set of configuration options that are applied in per-node manner.

First set of variables enables SRIOV for selected network adapters, by setting `sriov_enabled` as `true`, passing correct `names`, `bus info` and `device info` of the physical function interfaces. There's also options to define how many virtual functions should be created for each physical function and which ddp file will load. 
In below example `sriov_nics` configuration will create 4 VFs for Intel FVL NIC enp175s0f0 PF interface, with PCI bus info as "18:00.0" and attach them to vfio-pci driver and load "gtp.pkgo" ddp file; and create 2 VFs for Intel FVL NIC enp175s0f1 PF interface with PCI bus info as "18:00.1" and attach them to kernel mode iavf driver. It will also add IOMMU kernel flags, and as a result will reboot the target worker node during deployment.
```
sriov_nics:
  - name: enp175s0f0
    bus_info: "18:00.0"
    device_info: "8086:158b:0200"
    sriov_numvfs: 4
    vf_driver: vfio-pci
    ddp_profile: "gtp.pkgo"
    
  - name: enp175s0f1
    bus_info: "18:00.1"
    device_info: "8086:158b:0200"
    sriov_numvfs: 2
    vf_driver: iavf
```

Next option defines whether the SRIOV CNI plugin will be installed on the target worker node. Setting it to `true` will cause the Ansible scripts to build and install SRIOV CNI plugin in the `/opt/cni/bin` directory on the target server.
```
sriov_cni_enabled: true`
```

Please refer to the [SRIOV Network Device Plugin](https://github.com/intel/sriov-network-device-plugin) and [SRIOV CNI documentation](https://github.com/intel/sriov-cni) to get more details and usage examples.

# Known issues
* ICE 1.1.4 driver fails to load on Ubuntu 18.04, which is CVL driver limitation and will be fixed in CVL 2.2.
* Comms DDP profile loading works only on ICE driver 1.0.4+NVM 0.50 OR newer ICE driver than 1.0.4.

# Requirements
* Python 2 present on the target servers.
* Suggest to use "python 2.7" as ansible interpreter on CentOS7.6. 
* Ansible 2.9.6 (due to OpenNESS 20.03).
* pip==9.0.3 installed on the Ansible machine.
* SSH keys copied to all Kubernetes cluster nodes (`ssh-copy-id <user>@<host>` command can be used for that).
* Internet access on all target servers is mandatory. Proxy is supported.
* At least 8GB of RAM on the target servers/VMs for minimal number of functions (some Docker image builds are memory-hungry and may cause OOM kills of Docker registry - observed with 4GB of RAM), more if you plan to run heavy workloads such as NFV applications.
